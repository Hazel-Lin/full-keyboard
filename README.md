coding with your keyboard

## What is this?
This repo for record my coding habits with keyboard.

## Why?
Sometime my mouse don't work when I am coding so I need to use my keyboard to code, but I don't know how to do it. Well, I will record my habits here and try to make it better. Maybe it is a good way to improve my code efficiency.
